## Quickstart (Local)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Configure Secrets (Authentication & GitHub)
Create `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:
```toml
app_password = "replace-me"
allowed_users = ["accounts@bobjane.com.au", "finance@bobjane.com.au"]

# Optional GitHub integration
GITHUB_TOKEN = "ghp_your_token_with_repo_scope"
GITHUB_OWNER_REPO = "your-org/bjt-orders-tracker"
GITHUB_TARGET_PATH = "data/orders_tracker.csv"
GITHUB_TARGET_BRANCH = "main"
```

## Deploy on Streamlit Cloud
1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. On Streamlit Cloud, create a new app from the repo.
3. Set **Secrets** using the contents above.
4. (Optional) Configure environment variables in Streamlit if you want to override paths.

## GitHub Actions (Daily Backup)
A workflow at `.github/workflows/daily-backup.yml` copies `data/orders_tracker.csv` into a timestamped file under `backups/` each day and pushes the change.

## Contributing
- Use feature branches and open PRs.
- Keep UI changes small and accessible for Accounts team desktop usage.
- Add tests where helpful.

## Notes
- CSV edits in Streamlit persist on the running instance. Pushing to GitHub is manual (via button) unless you add your own automation.
- Duplicate protection is based on `(Order Number, Date of eComm Request)` pair.
- For private deployments, consider adding SSO in front of the app or integrating Streamlit's community-auth packages.
